# 🚀 End-to-End Power BI Project: Sales & Marketing Analytics Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Title
**Strategic Data Storytelling & Performance Intelligence through Power BI**

---

## 🧠 What This Project Represents

This project isn't just a dashboard — it's an end-to-end **data product** that translates raw business data into **strategic clarity** and **decision-ready insights**.

It represents how I approach real-world data challenges: with deep thinking, structured design, and full ownership from zero to final delivery. Every table, metric, and visual in this dashboard was built from scratch — with no templates, no pre-made solutions, and no shortcuts.

## 🔬 Objective & Vision Behind the Work

In this project, I wanted to:

- Move beyond surface visuals and into **real analytical depth**.
- Build a **flexible, interactive, multi-layered dashboard** that would help marketing and sales stakeholders make better decisions.
- Apply **analytical modeling logic** to reflect how businesses truly operate.
- Focus on UX, visual hierarchy, and storytelling — because good analysis isn't just about numbers, it's about making those numbers clear, powerful, and actionable.

## 📦 Dataset & Scenario

The data simulates a real business structure including:

- Sales transactions across multiple years
- Marketing campaign spend
- Customer segments
- Product categories
- Sales channels (digital, retail, etc.)
- Regional performance

My job was to bring this scattered data together and answer key business questions like:

- Which marketing channels deliver the best ROI over time?
- How do product categories perform across different regions?
- What seasonal trends can be observed in overall sales and spend?
- Where should the business focus its investment?

## 🧱 Full Technical Architecture

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Power Query)

- Removed missing values and duplicates across all source tables
- Normalized data types and regional inconsistencies
- Created standardized time-based columns for slicing (Month, Year, Quarter)
- Merged related entities (e.g., product + category, region + sub-region)
- Optimized load performance with query folding and proper transformations

### 2. 🧩 Data Modeling – Star Schema

- Built a clean **star schema** with:
  - FactSales
  - DimProduct
  - DimChannel
  - DimCustomer
  - DimRegion
  - DimDate
- Defined clear one-to-many relationships and enforced referential integrity
- Created calendar table with time intelligence functions

### 3. 🔢 DAX Calculations & KPIs

I wrote advanced **DAX measures** to track:

- Year-over-Year (YoY) and Month-over-Month (MoM) change
- Channel ROI = Revenue / Spend
- Dynamic Top N products by any category
- Profit margin, growth rate, and running totals
- Time-intelligent metrics with custom filters
- Campaign effectiveness per geography

All metrics were structured to be dynamic and responsive to user filters (date, region, product line, etc.)

### 4. 🎨 Visual & UX Design

The dashboard follows strict design principles:

- Visual hierarchy: KPIs at the top, trends in the middle, and deep-dives below
- Natural storytelling: from high-level performance to granular views
- Responsive filtering: slicers for Year, Region, Channel, and Product Type
- Visual diversity: bar charts, treemaps, KPI cards, area charts, combo charts, donut charts, heatmaps
- Mobile-friendly layout (with simplified responsive version)
