#  End-to-End Sales & Marketing Analytics Dashboard | Strategic Data Storytelling in Power BI

##  Project Summary

**A strategic, high-impact Power BI project transforming raw sales and marketing data into a multi-layered, business-ready dashboard.**

This project reflects more than just technical skills â€” it demonstrates the ability to turn scattered business data into a unified, intelligent product. It's not about building visuals â€” it's about designing an experience that empowers real decision-makers.

From the first row of raw data to the final slicer interaction, this dashboard represents deep thinking, data modeling expertise, and storytelling precision â€” all built around **business logic**.


##  Why This Project Matters

In todayâ€™s data-driven environment, sales and marketing leaders are flooded with numbers, charts, and disconnected KPIs. This project solves that problem â€” not by dumping data into dashboards â€” but by curating a **strategic analytics solution** that brings together the essential metrics, in context, and in flow.

Unlike templated dashboards or generic visuals, everything here is handcrafted: from the semantic model, to the DAX logic, to the visual layout. Itâ€™s not just a dashboard â€” itâ€™s a **decision-making interface.**


## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project is a full-scale implementation of a **Sales & Marketing analytics system** using Power BI. I handled every step â€” not using templates, not following tutorials â€” but applying critical thinking and analytical logic to build a solution that answers real performance questions.

The purpose was to extract clarity from raw data, structure it into insight, and make it instantly usable by any stakeholder â€” whether executive, product lead, or marketer.



##  Objectives & Vision

* Integrate and transform complex sales and marketing datasets.
* Deliver a flexible dashboard supporting **cross-functional strategic decisions**.
* Apply business logic through DAX to turn numbers into meaning.
* Build UX-focused visuals that create narrative, not clutter.



##  Full Technical Breakdown

###  Data Sources & Cleaning

* Imported structured transactional datasets for sales, campaigns, customers, products, and channels.
* Cleaned nulls, inconsistencies, and unmapped fields using Power Query.
* Normalized temporal data, currency values, and channel naming conventions.

###  Data Modeling (Star Schema)

* Structured all data into a star schema with one central Fact Table and supporting Dimensions.
* Built logical relationships to avoid ambiguity and ensure slicing across all filters.
* Used surrogate keys for custom granularity.

###  DAX Measures & KPIs

* Created dynamic DAX measures including:
  * YoY and MoM changes
  * ROI per campaign & channel
  * Ranked product performance
  * Segmented KPIs by region, category, and time
* Used CALCULATE, SWITCH, RANKX, DIVIDE, DATESYTD, and dynamic time-intelligence functions.

###  Visual Design Principles

* Balanced clarity and depth: used both high-level KPIs and deep drilldowns.
* Visuals include: KPI cards, combo charts, treemaps, donut charts, custom tooltips, and sparklines.
* Built a natural UX flow from overview to details with intuitive slicers and navigation.
* Visual hierarchy emphasizes the business question, not just data volume.

##  Final Thoughts

This wasnâ€™t just a practice â€” it was a real challenge in combining business strategy, data science, and UI thinking.

Everything here was designed by me from scratch: not just as a dashboard, but as a **data product** that delivers strategic clarity.

This reflects my mindset in data: **donâ€™t just visualize â€” synthesize, explain, and guide.**

I welcome insights or critiques from fellow data professionals.
